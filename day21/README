first part was easy/boring

for the second, 
- one idea is to create a matrix volume where the last dim represent the diff
  probable outcomes that round, which at the end of the round supplied with the
  modulo operator and flattened to a matrix
- another idea is to utilize the independence of each round and player and
  calculate them separately and be clever with the combinatoric

---
Each round for each player we get 27 diff. possible rolls, although their order
won't matter, their sum do.
Possible sums : `[3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
    Occurance : `[1,3,6,7,6,3,1]`
Idea: Squash each universe to a number of occurance rather than keeping them as
a distinct entry, they don't matter as long as they are at the same spot, so
each round doesn't add 27 possibilities just 7, as above.
