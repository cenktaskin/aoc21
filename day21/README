First part was easy/boring.

Second part was tricky.
Each round for each player we get 27 new universes. Order of the rolls doesn't
matter, their sum do.
Possible sums : `[3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
    Occurance : `[1,3,6,7,6,3,1]`

We only need to keep track of the current score and the posn, amount of
universes in that state can be the value at that cell. The resulting data
structure is `current_score X posn`.
